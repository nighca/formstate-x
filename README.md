formstate-x is a tool to help you to manage form state, based on [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/). formstate-x provides:

* **Composability**: Forms are composition of inputs, complex inputs are composition of simpler inputs. With composability provided by formstate-x, you can build arbitrary complex forms or input components with maximal code reuse.
* **Type safety**: With Typescript, no matter how complex or dynamic the form is, we provide type-safe result for value, error, validator, etc.
* **Reactive validation**: With reactivity system of MobX, every dependency change triggers validation automatically and you can easily react to state change
* **UI-independent**: formstate-x only deals with state / data, you can easily use it with any UI library you like
